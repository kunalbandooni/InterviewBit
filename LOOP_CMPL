Solution:- O(N + M) time, O(1) space

Explanation:-
The first loop is O(N) and the second loop is O(M). 
Since you don't know which is bigger, you say 
**this is O(N + M)**. This can also be written as O(max(N, M)).

Since there is no additional space being utilised, 
the space complexity is constant / O(1)

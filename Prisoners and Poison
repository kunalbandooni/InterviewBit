Solution: 9

Explanation:
Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write the number in binary format.

bottle 1 = 0000000001 (10 digit binary)
bottle 2 = 0000000010
bottle 500 = 0111110100
bottle 1000 = 1111101000
Now take 10 prisoners and number them 1 to 10, now let 
prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in
its least significant bit. Let prisoner 10 take a sip
from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit..

prisoner =  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
bottle 924 = 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
For instance, bottle no. 924 would be sipped by 10, 9, 8, 5, 4 and 3. 

That way if bottle no. 924 was the poisoned one, 
only those prisoners would die.

After four weeks, line the prisoners up in their 
bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit
and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. The number that 
you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned.

1000 is less than 1024 (2^10). If there were 1024 
or more bottles of wine it would take more than 
10 prisoners to do the experiment.

Now, lets look at the number of prisoners that 
will die in the worst case. Thats equal to the
maximum number of 1 bits in numbers from 0 - 999.
Number 511 has 9 1 bits. The first number with 10
set bits is 2^10 - 1 = 1023. Since, thats outside
our range, the maximum number of prisoners that will
die in the experiment is 9.

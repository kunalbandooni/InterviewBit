Solution:- 1

Explanation:-
Planes 1 and 2 take off eastbound, and travel a quarter of 
the way around the world. At this point, both their tanks
are half empty, so 2 transfers all of its fuel to plane 1
and lands. Now plane 1 has a full tank.Once plane 1 is
halfway around the world, plane 3 takes off westbound and
meets plane 1 when plane 1 is three quarters of the way 
around the world. At this point, plane 1’s tank is empty
and plane 3’s is half empty. Plane 3 then transfers all 
its fuel to plane 1, who is thus able to finish the last
quarter of the journey.

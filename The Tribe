Solution:- Truth Tribe

Explanation:-

Possible Combination:-
TLL
LTL
LLT

Lets assume that first person is from Truth tribe,
then he will claim that he is from the truth tribe,
in which case the second person is lying.

Now assume that first person is from Lie tribe.
Even then, he will say that he belongs to the 
truth tribe (as he is a liar), so second 
person is lying again in this case as well.

Thus third person is correct in both the scenarios, hence he belongs to Truth Tribe.

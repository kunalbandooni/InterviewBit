Suppose that there is a unit square. There are four cats sitting 
at the four different corners of the square. Each of those cats 
start chasing the other cat in the clockwise direction. The speed
of the cats are same and constant and they continuously change 
their direction in a manner that they are always heading straight
to the other cat.

How long will it take for the cats to catch each other?

Assume that each cat is running at 1 unit speed.


Solution: 

Let us denote the cats with A, B, C and D in a fashion that A is 
chasing B, B is chasing C, C is chasing D and D is chasing A.
The cats are moving in symmetry and thus the only logical answer 
is that they will meet at the center of the square. 

At any point of time, the Cat A is perpendicular to cat B and 
Cat B is perpendicular to Cat C and so on. Cat A runs for 
Cat B but Cat B does not run towards or away from Cat A for it
is moving in a perpendicular direction to Cat A. Thus the distance 
that need to be covered by Cat A to grab Cat B will be exactly 
same as the original distance between them which in this case 
is one unit (as it is a unit square).

Thus the speed of each cat towards the cat it is chasing will 
be [1 + cos (x)] where x denotes the angle on each corner.

Thus speed of the cat = 1 + cos (90) = 1 + 0 = 1

The time needed = Distance / Speed = 1/1 = 1 unit

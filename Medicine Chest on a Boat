Problem:

Alice and Bob are on separate islands. Bob is sick, and Alice has the
medicine. Eve has a boat and a chest that can be locked. She is willing
to transport objects between Alice and Bob, but only in the chest, and
if the chest is unlocked, she will steal whatever is inside.

If both Alice and Bob have a padlock and a key such that their own key
only opens their own lock.  Is it possible for Alice to send the medicine
to Bob? If so, how many minimum trips are required? Note that Bob and
Alice cannot travel in the boat. The boat going from Alice to Bob or Bob
to Alice counts as 1 trip.

You are on a strict medical regimen that requires you
to take two types of pills each day. You must take
exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill at the same
time. The pills are very expensive, and you don’t want
to waste any. So you open the bottle of A pills, and 
tap one out into your hand. Then you open the bottle of 
B pills and do the same thing – but you make a mistake,
and two B pills come out into your hand with the A pill.
But the pills are all exactly identical. There is no way 
to tell A pills apart from B pills. Is it possible to 
satisfy your regimen and take exactly one of each pill
at the same time, without wasting any pills?


Solution:-

Yes

Explanation:-

Cut each pill in half and divide them into two piles.
Then, take another A pill from the bottle, cut it in half,
and put each half in one of the piles. Now, each pile 
contains two halves from each type of pill, so you just 
take one of the piles (and the other the next day).

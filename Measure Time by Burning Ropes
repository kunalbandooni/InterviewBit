You have two ropes and a box of matches. Each rope takes exactly one hour to burn,
but they may not necessarily burn evenly â€“ i.e., the first half might burn in the 
first 10 minutes and the second in the remaining 50). What durations of time can 
you measure using the 2 ropes? Times do not have to start when the first rope is lit.

Problem:
You have two jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles.
You need to place all the marbles into the jars such 
that when you blindly pick one marble out of one jar,
you maximize the chances that it will be red. When 
picking, you’ll first randomly pick a jar, and then
randomly pick a marble out of that jar. You can arrange
the marbles however you like, but each marble must be 
in a jar. What is the maximum probability?

Solution:
0.75

Explanation:

If we put a single red marble in one jar and the rest of 
the marbles in the other jar, there is at least a 50%
chance of getting a red marble, since one randomly picked 
marble, doesn’t leave much room for choice.

Now, there are 49 red marbles left in the other jar, and
there is nearly even chance of picking a red marble (49 out of 99).
Calculating the total probability will give us:

P(red marble ) = P(Jar 1) * P (red marble in Jar 1) + P (Jar 2) * P (red marble in Jar 2)

P(red marble) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 49/99

P(red marble ) = 0.7474 = 0.75

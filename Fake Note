A man (M) bought a product worth Rs 200 from the Shopkeeper (X). 

He paid him through a 1000 Rs Note. 

Realizing that he did not have change, the shopkeeper X got change for that note from another shopkeeper (Y) and paid Rs 800 to the man.

After a few days, Y realized that the note is fake, And this railed at X and took 1000 Rs back from him.

So in this whole process how much money did X loose in the end?

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.

Solution: 1000


Explanation:

This question might seem to be confusing. But here’s the trick. The total loss must be equal to total profit. Here the loser is X and the gainers are M and Y. But actually Y doesn’t gain anything because he just got his money back. So, loss of X = gain of M = 200(for product) + 800(cash) = Rs.1000

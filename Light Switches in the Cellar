:) How?? Just check it out..

Turn light switch 1 to the ON position for a few minutes, 
then turn it off. Then turn on switch 2, and go upstairs. 
The light bulb that is off and hot is attached to switch 1.
The one that is on is attached to switch 2, and the one
that is off and cold is attached to switch 3.

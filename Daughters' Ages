Solution: 338

Explanation:
We know that there are 3 daughters whose ages
multiply to 72. Let’s look at the possibilities.

Ages:          Sum of ages:

1 1 72            74

1 2 36            39

1 3 24            28

1 4 18            23

1 6 12            19

1 8 9             18

2 2 18            22

2 3 12            17

2 4 9             15

2 6 6             14

3 3 8             14

3 4 6             13

After looking at the building number the second 
man still can’t figure out what their ages are, 
so that means that the sum of the ages (or 
building number) must be 14, since that is the 
only sum that has more than one possibility. 
Finally the man discovers that there is an 
oldest daughter. That rules out the “2 6 6″
possibility since the two oldest would be 
twins. Therefore, the daughters ages must 
be “3 3 8″.

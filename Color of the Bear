This question is really good, and funny (lol)

Calculating g, it comes as 10, which means the bear is found
where there is more gravity. 

The gravity is increased at the poles. and the South pole
doesnâ€™t have bears 
( http://sciencequestionswithchris.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/do-i-weigh-less-on-the-equator-than-at-the-north-pole/ ).

So the bear being referred to comes from North Pole. Hence, its white.

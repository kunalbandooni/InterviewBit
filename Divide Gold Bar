Solution:- 2 cuts

Explanation:-
Divide Gold bar as follows using 2 cuts:-

1   +   1-1   +   1-1-1-1
A        B           C

Day 1:  Give A (+1)

Day 2:  Get back A, give B (-1, +2)

Day 3: Give A (+1)

Day 4: Get back A and B, give C (-2,-1,+4)

Day 5: Give A (+1)

Day 6: Get back A, give B  (-1,+2)

Day 7: Give A (+1)

Hence, we need to make 2 cuts. 
Cut 1, so that the bar is divided into 1 and 6 pieces.
And second on the 6 piece bar, so that
it is divided into 2 and 4 pieces.

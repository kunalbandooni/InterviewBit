Problem:
You have 8 balls all look identical (in shape, color etc.).
All of them have same weight except one defective ball which
is heavier than others. You can use a two sided balance system 
(not the electronic one). Find the minimum no. of measures
required to separate the defective ball and the way you separate it.

Solution:
2

Explanation:
Letâ€™s name the balls 1-8. 
First we weigh {1,2,3} on the left and {4,5,6} on the right.
There are three scenarios which can arise from this.

If the left side is heavier, then we know that one of 1, 2 or 3 is the heavier ball.
Weigh {1} on the left and {2} on the right. 
By doing this, we will know if 1 or 2 is heavier. 
If they balance out, then 3 is the heavier one.

If the right side is heavier, then we know that either 4, 5 or 6 is the heavier ball. 
Weigh {4} on the left and {5} on the right. 
By doing this we will know if 4 or 5 is heavier. 
If they balance out, then 6 is the heavier one.

If {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} balance out, then we know either 7 or 8 is the heavier one. 
Weigh both of them to find out which one is heavier.

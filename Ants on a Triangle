Solution:- 0.25

Explanation:-

Let the three ants are a, b, c.

There are two cases when they will not collide, the one is 
when they all move clockwise and the other is when they 
all move anticlockwise.

They will collide if any two ants move towards each other, 
at the same time the third ant can move in clockwise or in
anticlockwise. so for each pair there are 2 such cases. And
there are 3 pairs possible (a,b), (b,c) and (c,a).
So total 3*2 = 6 cases when they will collide.
(Think yourself now :D )

So probability that they will not collide is 2/(2+6) i.e. 1/4 or 0.25

/*
I had to read it a few times to understand it.

A is an array that contains available seats in
that row. The ticket price is the number of 
empty seats in a row.

So looking at the examples:-

A = [2, 3] B = 3
There are 2 row with tickets available. The 
first row has 2 tickets and the second row has
3 tickets. To maximize profit, you want to
sell the $3 ticket first. 

That leaves 2 tickets available in both rows, 
according to condition in the question.

Since we need to sell 3 tickets. Weâ€™d sell 
the $3 and $2 ticket from the second row and
the $2 ticket from row one.

This leaves A[1,1].


A = [1, 4] B = 2
In this case, we take 2 from the second row.
The $4 and $3 ticket.
This will leave A[1,2]

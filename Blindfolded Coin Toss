You are blindfolded and 10 coins are place in front of you on table. 
You are allowed to touch the coins, but canâ€™t tell which way up they are by feel.
You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which.
Can you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? 
You can flip the coins any number of times.

Solution:-

YES

Explanation:-

Make 2 piles with equal number of coins. Now, flip all the coins in one of the pile.
How this will work? lets take an example.
So initially there are 5 heads, so suppose you divide it in 2 piles.

Case:
P1 : H H T T T
P2 : H H H T T
Now when P1 will be flipped
P1 : T T H H H
P1(Heads) = P2(Heads)

Another case:
P1 : H T T T T
P2 : H H H H T
Now when P1 will be flipped
P1 : H H H H T
P1(Heads) = P2(Heads)

Always Possible 

- here is exactly one line that passes through the centers of both 
  rectangles, the cake and the hole in it â€“ that is, of course, unless 
  they share a common center. This line divides both rectangles exactly
  in half, and this is the line along which you make the cut. 
  Hence, its always possible.

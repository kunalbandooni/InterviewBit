Solution:- 1

Explanation:-
Only one jelly bean from the p.b./grape jar will do the 
trick.The trick here is to realize that every jar is
mislabeled. Therefore you know that the peanut butter 
jelly bean jar is not the peanut butter jelly bean jar 
and the same goes for the rest.

You also need to realize that it is the jar labeled
p.b./grape, labelled as the mix jar, that is your
best hope. If you choose a jelly bean out of there,
then you will know whether that jar is peanut 
butter or grape jelly jelly beans. It can’t be
the mix jar because i already said that every jar is mislabeled.

Once you know that jar 3 is either peanut butter,
or grape jelly, then you know the other jars also.
If it is peanut butter, then jar 2 must be mixed because
it can’t be grape (as its labeled) and it 
can’t be peanut butter (that’s jar 3). Hence jar 1 is grape.

If jar 3 is grape, then you know jar 1 must be the mix 
because it can’t be p.b. (as its labeled) and it can’t
be grape (that’s jar 3). Hence jar 2 is peanut butter.

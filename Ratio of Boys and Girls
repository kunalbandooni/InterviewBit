Assume there are C number of couples so there would be C boys. The number of girls can be calculated by the following method.

	Number of girls = 0*(Probability of 0 girls) + 1*(Probability of 1 girl) + 2*(Probability of 2 girls) + …
	Number of girls = 0*(C*1/2) + 1*(C*1/2*1/2) + 2*(C*1/2*1/2*1/2) + …
	Number of girls = 0 + C/4 + 2*C/8 + 3*C/16 + …
	Number of girls = C
	(using mathematical formulas; it becomes apparent if you just sum up the first 4-5 terms)
The proportion of boys to girls is 1 : 1.

As such, the answer would be 1.00

// BE CAREFUL, AS THEY SAID TO ROUND OFF TO 2 DECIMAL PLACES. Therefore, "1.00" and not "1".

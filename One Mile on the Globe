Solution:- Infinity

Explanation:-
The north pole is one such place.

But, there are infinite points on Earth, which result same.
As, Earth is round... (Visualize on the Globe)

More Explanation:-
However, consider the points 1 + 1/(2*pi) miles away 
from the south pole. Call point A any of these 
(infinite number of) points. Go a mile south to point
B. When you go a mile east, you end up back at point 
B (you travelled once through every line of longitude). 
A mile north then brings you back to point A.

There are points still closer to the south pole such
that going a mile east brings you through each line
of longitude exactly twice, three times, or as many
times as you want. Thus we have an infinite number of
concentric rings of infinite numbers of points, and
we can start a mile north of any of them.

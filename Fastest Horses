Problem: 
There are 25 horses. We have to find out the fastest 3 horses.
In one race maximum 5 horses can run. How many such races are
required in minimum to get the result?

Solution:
7

Explanation:
Make group of 5 horses and run 5 races. 
Suppose five groups are a,b,c,d,e and next alphabet is its
individual rank in this group(of 5 horses).for eg. d3 means 
horse in group d and has rank 3rd in his group. [ 5 RACES DONE ] 
a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 
a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 
a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 
a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 
a5 b5 c5 d5 e5 

Now make a race of (a1,b1,c1,d1,e1).[RACE 6 DONE] 
suppose result is a1>b1>c1>d1>e1 

which implies a1 must be FIRST. 
b1 and c1 MAY BE(but not must be) 2nd and 3rd. 
FOR II position, horse will be either b1 or a2 
(we have to find top 3 horse therefore we choose horses b1,b2,a2,a3,c1 do racing among them [RACE 7 DONE]. 
The only possibilities are : 
c1 may be third 
b1 may be second or third 
b2 may be third 
a2 may be second or third 
a3 may be third 
The final result will give ANSWER. suppose result is a2>a3>b1>c1>b2 
then answer is a1,a2,a3,b1,c1. 
HENCE ANSWER is 7 RACES

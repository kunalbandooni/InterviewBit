Solution:
12

Explanation:
Numbers are 2 and 2.

S would have got 4, which means 1 + 3 or 2 + 2. so that’s why he was not sure of the numbers.

P would have also got 4, possibilities 14 and 22.

Now, had the numbers be 1 and 3, P would have got 3 and he would have been sure of the numbers, but that was not the case, So S became sure that numbers are 2 and 2.

Now, P knows that numbers cant be 1 and 4, because there are two possibilities of getting the sum as 5, 1+4, 2+3, and in both these cases S cant guess the number depending on P’s earlier answer, as for both product 4 and 6 there are more than 1 possibilities.

Thus P also knows that the numbers are 2 and 2.
